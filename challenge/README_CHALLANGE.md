# Requirements

You must create a virtual environment so that dependencies are not installed globally.

Consult how to create it depending on your operating system (linux, mac, windows, others).

Enter the back-end/django directory, run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the dependencies.

Create the database in MySQL, configure the account in settings.py.

Run the migrations and finally run python manage.py runserver to get the back-end server up.
