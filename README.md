# Requirements

# BackEnd:

Deploy a RESTful API using a backend framework of your choice (e.g.
example, Node.js with Express, Python with Flask/Django, etc.).
The API endpoints must support CRUD operations for elements
TODO: Create, Read, Update and Delete.
Use a database to store TODO elements. Choose a suitable database (e.g., SQLite
(e.g. SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) according to your preferences and requirements.

# FrontEnd:

Develop a user interface for the TODO application using a front-end framework
UI framework such as React, Angular or Vue.js.
Create components/pages to display TODO lists, add/edit TODO items
TODO elements and delete TODO elements.
Implement forms to add/edit TODO items with appropriate input fields.

# Customer Management Platform with API REST

Description:
My project consists of a comprehensive customer management solution designed to provide efficient and versatile management.
The platform allows users to create and manage multiple clients in an intuitive and effective way.

Main Features:
Customer creation and management: Users can create and manage multiple customers centrally.
CRUD functionality via REST API: A REST API has been implemented that allows access to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods for customer management remotely and securely.

Technologies Used: The system is developed using state-of-the-art technologies, including Python and Django for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and MySQL as a relational database.
Modern User Interface: The web application is developed in Angular, offering a dynamic and friendly user interface for the end user.

Code Structure and Quality Practices: During the development of the project, the focus was on rigorously following programming best practices, including the "Clean Code" principle.
This is reflected in the clear and organized structure of the code, as well as in the use of descriptive names for variables and functions.
Proper modularization of the code ensures long-term maintainability and scalability, while minimizing cyclomatic complexity improves readability and maintainability.
This commitment to code quality demonstrates our dedication to delivering a high-level technical product.

Tools Integration: Postman has been integrated to facilitate the testing and development of the REST API.
To perform unit tests in Django, we used the standard TestCase library provided by the framework itself. 
These tests are designed to verify the correct functioning of the different parts of the system in an isolated and automated way.
Test cases covering various scenarios have been created to ensure the robustness and reliability of the developed code.

Technologies Used: Python, Django, MySQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Bootstrap, CSS, SCSS, HTML, Postman, API REST Full.
This solution provides a robust and complete platform for client management, offering a seamless and efficient experience for both users and developers.
